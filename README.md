# buderus_ecomatic4000
ESPHome code for Buderus Ecomatic 4000 HS4201 with KM2.0 Serial Module M404.

The code is based on the software developed for the Logamatic 2107 KM271 serial module.
https://github.com/the78mole/esphome_components/tree/main

To compile the ESPHome code for the ESP32 it is necessary to copy
- the files from /my_components/km271_wifi
- and the file uart_read_line_sensor.h 

to the ESPHome directory of your Home Assistant.
